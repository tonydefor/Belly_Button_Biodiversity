We then created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

Additionally, we also created a bubble chart that displays the otu_id on the x-axis, sample_value on the y-axis, sample_value as the marker size, otu_id as the marker color and lastly, the otu_label as the hover-text value when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
